# Research Identity — Abdallah Kamaludin


## Who I Am
I am an Electrical & Electronics Engineering graduate transitioning into AI engineering and research, with a focus on **low‑resource natural language processing**.


My long‑term goal is to build and study language models for **underserved languages**, particularly Somali, Swahili, and Turkish, and to contribute open, reproducible research that expands access to AI.


## Core Research Niche
**Low‑Resource NLP & Language Models**


Focus areas:
- Dataset creation for underrepresented languages
- Tokenization and vocabulary design for morphologically rich languages
- Training and evaluating small‑to‑mid scale Transformers
- Practical deployment of language models for real communities


## Why This Matters
Most modern AI systems ignore languages spoken by hundreds of millions of people.


By working on Somali corpora, I aim to:
- Reduce data inequality in AI
- Enable local applications (education, translation, health, governance)
- Provide reproducible baselines for future researchers


## What This Repository Represents
This repository is a **long‑term research workspace**, not a tutorial dump.


It documents:
- Experiments
- Failures and insights
- Model implementations
- Dataset construction pipelines


Every phase reflects my progression from foundations → applied research → publishable work.


## Long‑Term Direction
- Publish open datasets and models
- Contribute to Hugging Face & open‑source NLP tooling
- Collaborate with academic labs and NGOs
- Enter a MSc or research program through demonstrated merit
